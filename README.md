# APII code from MUDAC 2019

The Minnesota Undergraduate Data Analytics Competition was a competition that myself and other undergraduate students competed in for the spring of 2019. We were given two specific water quality problems, both attempting to predict two water quality measures (total suspended solids and nitrate concentration). The second problem attempted to look at how rainfall intensity would impact these variables, and we were tasked with creating an index to represent rainfall intensity (annual precipitation intensity index). Our solution examined consecutive rainfall, and took inspiration from financial equations such as the compound interest formula to create a new index. This index ended up being highly correlated (r ~= 0.7) with the two dependent variables.
